Sage for High School
http://code.google.com/p/high-school-sage/

A GNU-FDL [1] book on Sage for high school mathematics by Minh Van Nguyen [2].
The book is written using the LaTeX [3] document preparation system. It uses
Mercurial [4] as its version control system. To clone the latest revision
of the book, ensure you have Mercurial installed on your system. Then issue
any of the following commands from your command line:

$ hg clone https://high-school-sage.googlecode.com/hg/ high-school-sage
$ hg clone http://high-school-sage.googlecode.com/hg/ high-school-sage

To compile a PDF version of the book, run the command

$ make

To delete junk files resulting from the compilation process, run

$ make clean

In fact, a successful compilation should automatically delete any junk
files resulting from the compilation process. The file util.sh is a script
that interfaces with utilities under the directory bin/.
