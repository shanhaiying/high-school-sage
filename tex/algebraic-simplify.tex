\chapter{Algebraic Simplification}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Simplifying algebraic expressions using the distributive laws:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item binomial expansion: $(a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$

  \item difference of two squares: $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$

  \item perfect squares: $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ and
    $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$

  \item perfect cubes

  \item sum and difference of two cubes
  \end{enumerate}

\item Simplifying rational expressions:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item addition of rational expressions

  \item subtraction of rational expressions

  \item multiplication of rational expressions

  \item division of rational expressions
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Collect like terms}
\index{like terms}

In simplifying an algebraic expression, a basic technique is
identifying like terms\index{like terms}, simplify them and in the
process we also simplify the whole expression. Two like terms can be
simplified to one term because only like terms can be added or
subtracted. The expression
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:algebraic_simplify:has_like_terms}
5x + 12x + 17y
\end{equation}
%
can be simplified because $5x$ and $12x$ are like
terms. Contrast~(\ref{eq:algebraic_simplify:has_like_terms}) with
\[
3x + 7y
\]
which has no like terms and cannot be simplified any further.

\begin{lstlisting}
sage: x, y = var("x, y")
sage: 5*x + 12*x + 17*y
17*x + 17*y
sage: simplify(5*x + 12*x + 17*y)
17*x + 17*y
sage: 3*x + 7*y
3*x + 7*y
sage: simplify(3*x + 7*y)
3*x + 7*y
sage: a, b, m, n = var("a, b, m, n")
sage: a + b^2 - 4*a*b + 3*a - b^2 - 2*a*b
-6*a*b + 4*a
sage: 3*(x^2)*(y^3) + 4*x*(y^2) - 9*(y^3)*(x^2) - 7*(y^2)*x
-6*x^2*y^3 - 3*x*y^2
\end{lstlisting}
