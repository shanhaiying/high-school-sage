\chapter{Algebraic Simplification}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Simplifying expressions involving addition and subtraction.

\item Simplifying algebraic expressions using the distributive laws:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item binomial expansion: $(a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$

  \item difference of two squares: $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$

  \item perfect squares: $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ and
    $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$

  \item perfect cubes

  \item sum and difference of two cubes
  \end{enumerate}

\item Simplifying rational expressions:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item addition of rational expressions

  \item subtraction of rational expressions

  \item multiplication of rational expressions

  \item division of rational expressions
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
